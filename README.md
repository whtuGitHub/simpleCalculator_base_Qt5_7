# simpleCalculator_base_Qt5_7
A simple calculator, based on Qt5.7.1

Gpa calculation function (fun 2) can be ignored, because its applicable objects are college students, and different schools calculation
rules might be different. Therefore, the focus is on the first function.

##this is the first time i use github,so it is my first project.
There may be many shortcomings and bugs, in fact, this project is not perfect, there are a lot of complex computing function is not
implemented, and the interface is not specially designed. But I will continue to work hard, also, every brother please give directions.
